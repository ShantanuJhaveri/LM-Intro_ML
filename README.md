# Learning Modules for Machine Learning and Artificial Intellegence:alien:
This is an ongoing repository that will contain learned modules, example work, and lecture notes for general ML/AI <br>
Right now, this repository only contains the repository for USC Course Applications of Machine Learning (ITP449-Senior_Data_Analytics). Follow the relative link below to view that repo (it also is literally just the folder titled "AppofML_ITP449"), but I put alot of effort into the markdown so check it out \;)

## Contents :package:
This Repository is broken up into curriculm and courses. This includes certifications and non-university work.
- [Applications of Machine Learning (ITP 449)](https://github.com/ShantanuJhaveri/LM-Intro_ML/tree/master/AppofML_ITP449)
- Introduction to Machine Learning (CSCI 467)
- Introduction to Artificial Intellegence (CSCI 360)
- Artificial Intellegence for Design Applications (ACAD 499)
## Material I made :package:
Having done all of these courses and certifications, I also spent time building curriculum and projects that I thought help me learn. Attached below are the repos to some of the projects I use to teach.
- [(CNN From Scratch using MNIST)](https://github.com/ShantanuJhaveri/T-MNIST_CNNapp)
- [(MNIST Dataset CNN App with Input)](https://github.com/ShantanuJhaveri/T-MNIST_CNNapp)
## Background 
Previous python basics and basic knowledge can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/ShantanuJhaveri/LM-Python_Basics)
