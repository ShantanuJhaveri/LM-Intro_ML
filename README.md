Right now, this repository only contains the repository for USC Course Applications of Machine Learning (ITP449-Senior_Data_Analytics). Follow the relative link below to view that repo (it also is literally just the folder titled "AppofML_ITP449"), but I put alot of effort into the markdown so check it out \;)
