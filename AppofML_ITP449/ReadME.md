# Applications of Machine Course Scripts and Material :blue_book: <br>
  This folder is for the USC Course Applications of Machine Learning (ITP449-Senior_Data_Analytics). Its purpose is to prove profiency in the class past just a grade, but also as a resource to come back to in case I forget some syntax<br>
  **THIS COURSE TAUGHT ALL OF SKLEARN + PANDAS + NUMPY
  ## Learning Outcomes :globe_with_meridians:
  This course focused on profiency in **APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS**. It was very syntax and statistically oriented, focusing efforts in teaching what models are most appropriate and how to score whether the model worked well. Machine Learning algorithms include **Decision Trees, KNN, Regression, Clustering K-means, and SVMs**
  ## Contents :package:
There are two folders. One is a documents repo and another is a code repo. Both are as described in their titled but more specifically:
#### Document Repo 
The documents contain things like lectures, lecture notes, hw documents, and misc documentation.
#### Code Repo
The code in here range from what I actually did on my HW submisions, my sandboxes, datasets I was playing around with, and even the build environment. Each hw#\_files_ folder contains each question seperately (as to the teachers orders). The code starts rudamentary with basic to more advanced python knowledge from assignments 1-4 (although I did try to through some spicy data structures into it) but then moves on to be more ML oriented in folders 5-8. I will try to include learning outcomes and outputs in readme files attached to each folder
